      <p>
        Pricing for our Services and the individual Blooprints, templates, and
        files are determined based on the Creator’s Terms of Use. The price of
        each individual piece of content will be set forth at the time of your
        purchase. Note, however, pricing may be different depending on the
        status of a user. For example, new users may receive promotional
        pricing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you log in to your account the pricing will reflect your home
        country’s currency; otherwise, if you are not logged in, depending on
        the country where you are located, pricing will reflect the currency of
        such country.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and
        services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we
        shall collect and remit such to the proper tax authorities to the extent
        required by applicable law. Depending on your location, the price you
        see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout. In the
        event we do not collect such taxes at checkout, you may be liable for
        the payment of the same to the taxing authorities and agree to comply
        with your tax filing and payment obligations related to your purchases.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each question you register for, you are responsible for and agree to
        pay the fees associated with such. In this regard, you authorize us to
        charge your debit or credit card or process other valid means of payment
        for the applicable fees. All payments must be valid and authorized.
        Should your payment be declined for any reason, you remain responsible
        for issuing payment for the selected Creator’s template. We expressly
        reserve the right to disable your access to any Blooprints or Project
        Templates for which we have not received irrevocable payment for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should the purchased Blooprint not meet be what you were expecting, you
        can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the delivered template
        from the Creator, that we apply a refund to your account. We shall have
        the sole discretion as to whether a refund shall be issued. We reserve
        the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your
        original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of
        our payment processing partners, the platform from which you purchased
        your question, and other factors. In no event shall refund be due to you
        if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed,
        unless the template is disabled by us or otherwise required by
        applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any refund
        credits may expire if not used within the specified period, and have no
        cash value.
      </p>
      <p class="below-headings">
        If we believe, in our sole discretion, you are abusing our refund policy
        (i.e. if you have utilized a more than nominal portion of the templates
        that you want to refund or if you have previously received a refund), we
        reserve the right to deny your refund request, ban your account, and/or
        restrict all future use of our Services. If we ban your account or
        disable your access to the templates due to your violation of these

        Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act ("CDA") (and the

        when such online service providers provide or make available access to
        third party user generated content (see § 230 (c)(1) which states: “No
        provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as
        the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
        information content provider).” The decision by BLOOPRINTED to remove or

        Legal Disputes Subject to Arbitration, Dispute Resolution, and Class
        Action Waiver
      </div>
      <p style="font-weight: 900 !important">
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS,
        INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and
        all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out
        of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether
        based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other
        legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms of Use or any prior
        agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to interactions
        between users); and claims that may arise after the termination of these
        Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to resolve any and all disputes with BLOOPRINTED as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: For any and all disputes, claims, or
        controversies you may have against BLOOPRINTED (“Disputes”), whether
        pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity
        to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us through this link
        with the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a
        written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific
        relief you seek. If we do not resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45)
        days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue resolution
        of the Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court
        only under the circumstances described below.
      </p>
      <p>Arbitration Procedures</p>
      <p>
        If the Dispute has not been resolved and is not subject to the
        exclusions provided above, then either party may initiate binding
        arbitration as the sole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the
        terms set forth below.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance
        with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims
        that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
        and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the
        rules and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,
        excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
        You can find the JAMS rules and procedures here at this link:
        https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write
        a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and
        the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a
        Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the
        Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, NY
        Times Building, 620 8th Ave, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018; and (3)
        send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration to BLOOPRINTED at NY
        Times Building, 620 8th Ave, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018 , ATTN:
        Legal Department.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us.
        If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, each party
        will pay an equal share of all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including
        filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for
        your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable
        law provide otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Location of Arbitration: If you live in the United States, you may
        initiate and litigate the arbitration in your hometown area or through
        the JAMS office located in New York, New York. If you live outside the
        United States, you must initiate and litigate the arbitration through
        the JAMS office located in New York, New York. Either party may ask that
        the arbitration, including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences,
        be conducted telephonically or by video conference (e.g., Skype).
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,
        shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or
        relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
        formation of these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy or any additional
        policy of BLOOPRINTED, including but not limited to any claim that all
        or any part of such is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to
        arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The
        arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be
        available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award
        shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered
        in any court with jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration
        provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury
        trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of
        arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
        discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLASS ACTION WAIVER: The parties agree that the arbitration shall be
        conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action
        or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their
        right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS
        THAT YOU AND BLOOPRINTED AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
        OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR
        REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
        SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY
        EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR
        ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR
        OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY INITIATED
        ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY
        THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY A SINGLE
        ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS
        CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE
        CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO
        DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH
        RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE
        CONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The arbitrations have a common question of law or fact;</li>
        <li>The issues in the multiple arbitrations are largely identical;</li>
        <li>
          There are common claims, disputes, defenses, and relationships between
          or among the parties in the different arbitrations;
        </li>
        <li>One or more parties is named in multiple pending arbitrations;</li>
        <li>
          The arbitrations relate to the same campaign featured on BLOOPRINTED’s
          platform;
        </li>
        <li>Consolidation will save time and resources;</li>
        <li>
          One party will be seriously prejudiced by having multiple arbitrations
          heard separately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="below-headings">
        By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury
        or to participate in a class action. We are also waiving these rights.

        Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the
        parties' agreement to resolve Disputes through arbitration, either party

        arising from or relating to misuse, infringement, or misappropriation of
        intellectual property theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual
