      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this, we responsibly collect and utilize personally
        identifiable information. We respect your privacy, and this Privacy
        Policy documents our commitment to safeguard and treat your privacy and
        the personal information that we collect online with reasonable care and
        in strict compliance with applicable law for the protection of
        personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy was implemented as of June 22, 2021 and applies to
        information collected on this website and those of our affiliates
        (together, “our website” or “the website”) and covers the following
        areas:

        b). How Blooprinted uses this information;

      <p class="below-headings">
        This Privacy Policy applies only to our website and information
        collected for us or by us through our website and through various
        features and online offerings on our website. It does not apply to any
        third party site or service linked to our website or recommended or
        referred by our website or by our staff. Further, it does not apply to
        any other type of online site or online service operated by Blooprinted
        or its affiliates, or to any of our offline activities.
      </p>
      <div class="sub-heading text-regalBlue">
        1. Information Collection and Use
      </div>
      <p>
        Blooprinted collects two different types of information through our
        website: anonymous information and personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymous Information. We collect and store anonymous, aggregate
        information (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types,
        search engines, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
        platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) from all visitors
        to our website. You may search our website for Services and other
        information provided through our website without ever submitting your
        name, email address or any other personally identifiable information.
        The anonymous information that we do collect from your visit is never
        linked to any of your personally identifiable information until you
        voluntarily submit that personal information, in which case some
        otherwise anonymous information may be connected to your website
        activity and personal account. Otherwise, the anonymous information is
        only used in the aggregate to analyze trends, administer the website,
        diagnose any problems, track a visitor’s movement in the aggregate, and
        gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may provide
        this anonymous information in aggregate form to other parties or use it
        for our own insight or marketing purposes. Our ability to use this
        information is not restricted in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use “cookies” and “image tags” to collect certain usage
        information from all customers and visitors to our website. A “cookie”
        is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard
        drive or on your mobile device’s memory in order to collect information
        about your activities on our website. An “image tag,” also known as a
        clear GIF or web beacon, works together with cookies and is a small
        image file that may be located in various areas of our website. Most
        browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change
        your browser setting to decline them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting cookies in no way gives us access to your computer or any
        personal information about you, since cookies are not used to identify
        anonymous website visitors. Our cookies enable you to proceed smoothly
        through our website and know whether you’ve used it before, so as to
        eliminate some steps that apply to new visitors. Cookies also give us
        usage data like how often you visit, where you go on our website, and
        what you do while here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, with your permission, we may collect information about your use
        or interaction with our website or about the devices you use to connect
        or interact with our website by automated means, including tracking
        technologies. As discussed above, these tracking technologies may
        include “cookies,” which are small lines of text/data that are written
        onto your device by a website. Most browsers allow you to block and
        delete cookies. However, if you do that, the website may not work
        properly. Blooprinted and suppliers acting on our behalf may use
        cookies, pixel tags, beacons, web beacons, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
        monitoring and other technologies to operate the website and to provide
        services. With your consent, we may also use technologies to capture
        your demographic information and engagement with us in order to present
        you with a more personalized experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites
        that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These
        features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond
        to those signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally Identifiable Information. We require the submission of
        certain personally identifiable information when you use some Services
        available on our website, including, (1) educational information, (2)
        employment history, (3) financial information, to the extent permitted
        by law, (4) family details (dependents, ages, marriage, prior marriage),
        (5) Home address (current, past), home telephone, cell phone, (6) Social
        security status, (7) driver’s license, (8) race/gender and (9) banking
        information. For example, your use of your user name and password allows
        us to identify you in connection with our services. Our website uses a
        variety of contact forms and tracking phone numbers for visitors to
        request information, products, and services. We collect a visitor’s
        contact information (like his or her email address or phone number) and
        in some cases, demographic information (like his or her zip code). We
        use this information to get in touch with our prospective users about
        their requests, and to send them additional information about our
        products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that once you have elected to voluntarily provide personally
        identifiable information to us, we may use cookies to help identify you.
        Personally identifiable information received from you (such as IP
        address, phone number, email address, zip code, etc.) may be contained
        in or linked to a cookie. The only time that we receive such personally
        identifiable information is when you volunteer it by submitting it to
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies with personally identifiable information so that our
        website can remember you, enhance your online visit with us, and provide
        you with the information you’re most likely to need. For instance,
        cookies allow our website to remind you of your past search interests
        and website activity and to suggest similar products and Services. In
        some cases, cookies may improve your experience and we use information
        gained through cookies to track your website activity and to deliver you
        content specific information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any financial information we collect is used to check the qualifications
        of our prospective user and bill for products and Services ordered. The
        collection, use and storage of your financial information for purchasing
        products and Services may be subject to additional privacy policies and
        if so, you will be notified of them at the time of any such collection,
        use or storage of your financial information as required by law.
      </p>
      <p class="below-headings">
        Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like an
        email address or phone number) which they may voluntarily provide. We
        also may run contests on our website in which we ask visitors for
        similar contact information in order to participate. We use contact
        information from our surveys and contests to send information about
        products and services to these participating visitors.

        2. Our Use Restrictions on Your Personally Identifiable Information
      </div>
      <p>
        Blooprinted does not sell, rent, or share personally identifiable
        information to or with any third party not affiliated with or owned by
        Blooprinted, except service providers who may assist us in such areas as
        our promotions, Services and data storage. Blooprinted will never give
        or sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third
        parties to be used for the purposes of sending you unsolicited
        commercial offers, such as spam. We may, however, use your personal
        information to send you commercial offers in e-mails from Blooprinted or
        its affiliated companies, which do not relate to the products or
        services you have ordered or registered for. You may altogether avoid or
        opt out of these marketing campaigns (see “Opting Out” below).
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also need to contact you for purposes other than marketing, for
        example to provide notice about the status of our website or the
        specific services you have requested. We also use this information to
        the extent necessary to enforce our website terms of service and to
        prevent imminent harm to persons or property. You may not opt-out of
        these kinds of communications. Consistent with our change policy (see
        “Your Consent and Notification of Changes” below), we will post any
        updates or notices about material changes in our policies on collection
        and use of your personally identifiable information to this Privacy
        Policy page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we may share your information for the following business
        and commercial purposes:
      </p>

        a). When you elect to register or participate in a Service, we share
        your information with the user, in one regard, and the service provider,
        in the other regard, so the user or service provider, as applicable, can
        communicate with one another. All users or service providers are
        responsible for complying with Blooprinted’s applicable Terms of Use,
        this Privacy Policy, and all other applicable Blooprinted policies, and
        to the extent applicable, adopting them into the services provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        b). for compliance purposes like payment processing, tax purposes, and
        identity verification.
      </p>
      <p class="below-headings">
        c). at your direction, including, without limitation, sharing with
        third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, and
        public forums.

      </div>
      <p class="below-headings">
        We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we
        have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply

        served on us or to comply with the request of a law enforcement agency,

        personally identifiable information. For example, we encrypt
        communications through our website with commercial strength encryption
        generally used by our industry. However, given the nature of the
        Internet and the fact that network security measures are not perfect, we

        10. Claims of Infringement
      </div>
      <p>
        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides
        recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the
        Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe
        in good faith that materials hosted by Blooprinted infringe your
        copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the
        material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include
        the following information as required by 17 USC.§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a
        physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf
        of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b)
        identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
        (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a
        single notification, a representative list of such works); (c)
        identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the
        subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to
        allow Blooprinted to locate the material on the site; (d) the name,
        address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the
        complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good
        faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
        authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a
        statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
        under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to
        act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
        infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright
        infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to
        send Blooprinted a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet
        the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA
        (http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details). Notices and counter-notices
        with respect to the Site should be sent by email to or mail to
        team@blooprinted.com mail to Blooprinted, LLC P.O. Box 896, Pine Brook
        NJ 07058.
      </p>
      <p class="below-headings">
        We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or
        counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims
        under the DMCA.
